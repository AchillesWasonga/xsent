XSent is a hackathon-ready, sentiment-driven forecasting tool that turns real-time conversation on X (Twitter) into actionable signals for prediction markets. It ingests live tweets for a topic, uses xAI to score sentiment and generate concise rationales, then correlates the sentiment trend with active markets on Kalshi. The MVP ships as a lightweight Python stack (FastAPI + Streamlit) so you can demo fast: query a topic, see the sentiment curve, view matching Kalshi markets, and display a simple “lean Yes/No” signal with reasoning. XSent is built to showcase how language agents + social sentiment can anticipate belief updates in markets—perfect for the X & xAI track and the Chestnut Forty “predict the future” theme.
